1.1 Weights of undirected graph G all value w. Create algorithm to make MST. Faster than Prim?

1.2 One edge is w'. Modify algorithm. What is running time? Compare to part (a)/Prim. 

2 > Edge weights are 1 to W. Modify PRim's to acieve running time O(E + VW).

3 > Kruskal's algorithm requires a disjoint-set data structure that can perform oeprations MAKE-SET, FIND-SET and UNION. 

The disjoint needs to have this property: any sequence of m operations runs in O(mlogn), where n is the numbers of MAKE-SET operations. 

4 > Bellman-Ford with vertex z as source. 

4.1 Relax edges in order: (t,x), (t,y), (x,t), (y,x), (y,z), (z,x), (z,s), (s,t), (s,y). Show d and parent values at each pass. 

4.2 Change weight of (z,x) to 4 with s as the source.
